## Contributing

If you want to contribute an example, create a sub-folder (e.g. `lein new app foo` for that example and give it a nice, tutorial-like readme explaining:

- What the example does
- Why you might want to do it
- How to go about doing it
- Why this approach is preerable to others

Make the project do something awesome.
